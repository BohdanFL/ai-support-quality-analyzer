When you are transferred, the Refund Resolution Team will likely inquire about your case in more detail, including your order specifics and the previous communication you've had with our company. They will then review your case and provide a more detailed update on the status of your refund, including a more precise timeline for when you can expect to receive it. I daresay, they will be more than happy to walk you through every step of the process and provide you with a clear understanding of what to expect moving forward. And, once again, I do apologize for any confusion or frustration this may have caused, and I am confident that they will be able to provide you with the assistance you require."
